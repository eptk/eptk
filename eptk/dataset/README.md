# eptk
Energy Prediction Toolkit (eptk) is a python package for implementing and benchmarking energy use prediction models on a collection of large datasets using standard performance metrics. The package includes a variety of predictive models along with a set of configurations that were picked from the top performers in the ASHRAE - Great Energy Predictor III competition hosted on Kaggle.
 The package provides methods for engineering additional features (temporal, weather and rolling stats) from the datasets. The package also provides ensembling techniques such as meta-regressors, Bayesian optimization and subsampling to combine multiple models. The custom cross validator which is used for benchmarking can resume evaluation from a stored checkpoint in the event of failure during runtime. The datasets are first downloaded in the working directory if not found while calling the load method.
